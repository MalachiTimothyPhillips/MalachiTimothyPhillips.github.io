This paper considers the use of 4th-kind and optimized 4th-kind Chebyshev,
polynomials as accelerators for multigrid smoothing.
These methods are developed in James Lottes's excellent paper, [Optimal polynomial smoothers for multigrid V-cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08830).
We extend the analysis of Lottes to the case of one-sided V-cycles,
and show that, for large values of the multigrid approximation constant,
smoothing with $2k$-order Chebyshev polynomials on one-side
yields superior convergence to smoothing with $k$-order Chebyshev polynomials on both sides.
