Demonstrate improved convergence rate using novel 4th-kind and optimal 4th-kind Chebyshev smoothers
based on Lottes's work [Optimal polynomial smoothers for multigrid V-cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08830).
In addition, analyze the applicability of one-sided V-cycles to improve
the convergence rate of Chebyshev smoothers in both a high-order $p$-multigrid and
finite difference geometric multigrid applications.
