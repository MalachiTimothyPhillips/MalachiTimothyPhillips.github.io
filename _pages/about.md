I am a 5th year PhD student in CS at UIUC. I am advised by [Prof. Paul Fischer](http://fischerp.cs.illinois.edu/).
My research interests are in matrix-free high-order Poisson preconditions,
especially for GPU-architectures.
I am also interested in high-order methods for fluid flow simulations.
My main dissertation work is on things related to [nekRS](https://github.com/nek5000/nekrs), a high-order finite element solver for the Navier-Stokes equations.

I am a member of the [Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations](https://ceed.exascaleproject.org/).

I am a long-term intern at Sandia National Labs since May 2016.
The work I've done there is primarily focused on porting a large,
expression graph based finite element multiphysics simulation software to
utilize GPUs, SIERRA/Aria [user manual](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1615880).
