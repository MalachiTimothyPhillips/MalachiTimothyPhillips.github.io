I am a Postdoctoral Appointee at Sandia National Labs, a position I started in September 2023.
My current work is focused on block-based multiphysics preconditioning strategies in [Trilinos](https://github.com/trilinos/).
Prior to completing my PhD, I interned at Sandia National Labs starting May 2016.
During that time, my work has been primarily focused on porting a large,
expression graph based finite element multiphysics simulation software to
utilize GPUs, SIERRA/Aria [user manual](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1615880).

I obtained my PhD in CS at UIUC in August 2023 and was advised by [Prof. Paul Fischer](http://fischerp.cs.illinois.edu/).
My research interests are in matrix-free high-order Poisson preconditions,
especially for GPU-architectures, and high-order methods for fluid flow simulations.
My main dissertation work is on things related to [nekRS](https://github.com/nek5000/nekrs), a high-order finite element solver for the Navier-Stokes equations.
